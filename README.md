# MLP Lower Back Pain Classifier 
This is project is a assignent from the Inteligent Systems of the computer engineering course. The goal is to train and explore a MLP network to classify lower back pain based on a data set.

The work is based on analising the data set, establishing the relations and features of the atributes:

than training a MLP with the data with stablished parameters such as activation function and optimizastion method.

finally, search for the best neural network by change such parameters and analising the results.
